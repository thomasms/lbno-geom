To install the software, use the scripts in the third_party directory.
For these to work some additional packages are required:
    i. wget - should be already included on linux, mac requires MACPORTS or FINK software, then use apt-get install wget
    ii. cmake - script included for this also

If both of these are installed then:
   i. Setup environment variable $THIRD_PARTY_DIR to point to this directory
   ii. Source install_all.sh in scripts directory

If root fails to compile and this message occurs in the root build log file:

  Checking for libXpm ... /sw/lib
  Checking for libXft ... /sw/lib
  Checking for libXext ... /usr/X11R6/lib
  configure: libXext not in same directory as libX11
  For consistency they should be in the same directory

Then you need to copy all libXpm* and libXft* and libXext* into the same directory i.e /sw/lib
to ensure consistency and then root can configure
